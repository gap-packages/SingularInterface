Just to remind ourselves:

Only
  configure.ac
  Makefile.am
  src/Makefile.am
  m4/*

are actually edited. Everything else is produced by

  autoreconf

It runs "aclocal -I m4" and then "automake" and "autoconf".

We use autoconf version 2.65, if you use another version then
replace 
  config.guess
  config.sub
  depcomp
  install.sh
as well (and possibly run autoreconf).
