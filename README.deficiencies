The following is not (yet) so nice:

src/Makefile.am has "x86_64-Linux" hard-wired in it to find header
files of singular, how can this be avoided/deteced?

After compiling and linking, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or corresponding
feature on other system than linux) has to be set such that
  libsingular.so
is found. You can check the success of this with
  ldd bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc/64-bit/libsing.so
