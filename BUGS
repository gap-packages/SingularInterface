Singular(""); gives no method found although "" seems to be in
IsStringRep.

SI_bigint(1); does not work, gives:
<singular bigint:-1408746431>

Tocheck:

 - memory management stress test
 - performance of high level
 - Calls to 2, 3, and many arguments
 - error handling with call to 1 argument
 - lots of code paths in SI_GETSINGOBJ
