Compiling SingularInterface
===========================
The following instructions require that GNU autoconf, automake
and libtool are installed on your system.

SingularInterface requires Singular 4.0.1 or later, and that Singular
and GAP are compiled against the exact same version of the GMP
library.

The easiest way to achieve that is to compile Singular yourself,
telling it to link against GAP's version of GMP.

Therefore, usually the first step towards compiling SingularInterface
is to build such a special version of Singular.  The following
instructions should get you going.

1. Fetch the Singular source code. For your convenience, we provide
   two shell scripts which do this for you. If you want to use
   Singular 4.1.2p1, run
     ./fetchsingular
   If you want the development version run
     ./fetchsingular.dev

2. Prepare Singular for compilation. At this point, you need to know
   against which version of GMP your GAP library was linked:
   If it is a GMP version installed globally on your system, simply run:   
     ./configuresingular
   If it is the version of GMP shipped with GAP, run this instead:
     ./configuresingular --with-gmp=GAP_DIR/bin/GAPARCH/extern/gmp
   where GAP_DIR should be replaced with the path to your GAP installation,
   and GAPARCH by the value of the GAParch variable in GAP_DIR/sysinfo.gap

3. Compile Singular by running
     ./makesingular

4. Now we turn to SingularInterface. As first step, you need to setup
   its build system. To do this, run this command:

   ./autogen.sh

5. Prepare SingularInterface for compilation, by running
   ./configure --with-gaproot=GAP_DIR  --with-libSingular=$PWD/singular/dst

6. Compile SingularInterface:
    make

7. To make sure everything worked, run the test suite
    make check
