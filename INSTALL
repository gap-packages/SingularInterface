Compiling libsing
=================
For libsing to work, it is necessary that you use Singular 4.0.0
or later, and that Singular and GAP are compiled against the
exact same version of the GMP library.

The easiest way to achieve that is to compile Singular yourself,
telling it to link against GAP's version of GMP.

Therefore, usually the first step towards compiling libsing is to build
such a special version of Singular. 
The following instructions should get you going.

1. Fetch the Singular source code. You can either use a released version of
   Singular, such as 4.0.0, or the latest development version. Place the
   resulting source code into the subdirectory
     singular/src/
   For your convenience, we provide two shell scripts which
   do this for you. If you want to use Singular 4.0.0, run
     ./fetchsingular
   If you want the development version run
     ./fetchsingular.dev

2. Prepare Singular for compilation. At this point, you need to know
   against which version of GMP your GAP library was linked:
   If it is a GMP version installed globally on your system, simply run:   
     ./configuresingular
   If it is the version of GMP shipped with GAP, run this instead:
     ./configuresingular --with-gmp=GAP_DIR/bin/GAPARCH/extern/gmp
   where GAP_DIR should be replaced with the path to your GAP installation,
   and GAPARCH by the value of the GAParch variable in GAP_DIR/sysinfo.gap

3. Compile Singular by running
     ./makesingular

4. Now we turn to libsing. As first step, you need to setup its build
   system. To do this, simply run this command:

   ./autogen.sh

4. Prepare libsing for compilation, by running
   ./configure --with-gaproot=GAP_DIR  --with-libSingular=$PWD/singular/dst \
               CONFIGNAME=default64
   where you should replace GAP_DIR as above. If you know what
   you do, you can change your CONFIGNAME (but note that
   libsing should only be used with 64 bit versions of GAP).

5. Compile libsing:
    make
