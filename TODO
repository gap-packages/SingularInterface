Fix path in lib/libsing.gi, because it contains the Singular version!
proxy implementation for intmats and intvecs?
More constructors (or less, if accessible via high level)
Quick polynomial constructor
More view and print routines
proxies for Singular interpreter variables
generic copying for singular objects (and proxy objects)
access to def and proc ?
Help-function to see available Singular-Funktions
Method installations for conveniences like +, -, * etc.
Better ring constructor
Try to run manual examples
Tuning using low level interface
get rid of SING_GETPOLY
check automatic type changes
explicit type casts?

Ring constructors:

  Provide functionality:

  gap> SingularRing(32003,["a","b","c"],[["dp",[PARAMETER]]);
  gap> SingularRing(32003,["a","b","c"],[["dp",NRVARS],["lp",NRVARS],
  gap>      ["wp",[GEWICHTE]]]);

  i.e.:
     SingularRing( CHARACTERISTIC as immediate integer,
                   VARIABLE NAMES as list of strings
                   ORDERINGS as list of
                     list with entries STRING, INT   (nr of vars)
                       or with entries STRING, [WEIGHTS]   (intlist)
                 );
     delegating to
       ring rDefault(int ch, int N, char **n,int ord_size, int *ord, int
                     *block0, int *block1, int ** wvhdl=NULL);
       ord, block0, block1 must be omalloced
            (first variable, last variable, 1-based)
            ord is 0-terminated
       wvhdl must be alloced, each is
            NULL
         or a pointer to an int array also omalloced

     use rOrderName to convert from string to order number for ord
     (this frees string!)



More TODO:

proxy objects to look into matrices
why does SI_print do nothing (or does it do anything?)
