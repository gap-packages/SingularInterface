Mutability of arithmetic results:
  binary + and - and unary - are done.
  However, binary - seems to delegate to unary - and +.

  Anyway, should we generally impose the immutability law for arithmetic
  operations to all singular function calls?
    (i.e. if all arguments are immutable, then the result is as well)
  This could be done in the kernel rather efficiently.

  Also, for singular objects, one can change from immutable back to
  mutable relatively easily. So the above could be a good default
  in any case.

  This would simplify and speed up quite a lot of code with the arithmetic.
