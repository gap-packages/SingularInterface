libsing -- a GAP package for interfacing with Singular
=======

libsing interfaces to the Singular interface on the kernel level.

This differentiates it from e.g. the GAP package "singular", which
instead starts a regular Singular binary as a subprocess,
and communicates with that by sending text commands (just
as a user would), and then parsing the text replies Singular
issues.

Directly interfacing with the Singular C kernel is more complicated,
but has the advantage of avoiding parsing issues due to changed
output formatting, and also in general tends to be much, much
faster.

Obtaining libsing
=================
You can obtain the latest version of libsing from

  https://github.com/gap-system/libsing


Requirements
============
Currently libsing should work on any UNIX-like platform, including Linux
and Mac OS X.

Right now, there is no support for Windows, mainly because none of the
libsing developers uses Windows, but also because running GAP and
Singular on Windows is a bit tricky. If you are interested in Windows
support, please contact us.

You will likely need the following tools to build libsing:

* GNU autoconf
* GNU automake
* GNU libtool
* git

Most Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, ...) already
provide suitable packages for all of these. On Mac OS X, the most
convenient way to install them is also via a package manager like Fink,
MacPorts or Homebrew. Alternatively, you can install any of the above
manually.
   

Compiling libsing
=================
Unfortunately, libsing cannot simply use an already existing Singular on
your system. Instead, one has to compile Singular in a special mode to
ensure it will be compatible with your GAP installation.

Therefore, the first step towards compiling libsing is to build such a
special version of Singular. Right now, there are two options you have
for that:

  I. Use a classic version of Singular (such as 3-1-6)

 II. Use the development version of Singular (a.k.a. "spielwiese"),
     which will eventually become Singular 4.0.

Most regular users will want to use option I for now, but for libsing
developers option II may be interesting to ensure libsing will work
with future Singular versions.

The following instructions should get you going.

0. If you obtained libsing directly from its git repository, the first thing
   to do is setup its build system. Run this command:

   ./autogen.sh

1. Fetch the Singular source code. We provide shell scripts which
   do this for you by directly using the Singular git repository.
   If you want to go with option I, run
     ./fetchsingular
  For option II, run 
     ./fetchsingular.sw


2. Prepare Singular for compilation, by running
     ./configuresingular
  For option II, run 
     ./configuresingular.sw

3. Compile Singular (this step is separate from step 2 to help libsing
   developers who may wish to modify the Singular code, then recompile it).
     ./makesingular
  For option II, run 
     ./makesingular.sw

4. Prepare libsing for compilation, by running
    ./configure --with-gaproot=PATH_TO_GAP
  For option II, run 
    ./configure --with-gaproot=PATH_TO_GAP --with-sw --with-libSingular=$PWD/SW

5. Compile libsing:
    make
